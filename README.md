# BungeeUtils
* This util was created by another person, the truth is that I don't know the person, that's why I don't leave credits, but the code was changed by 80% and it was improved.

# Features
* Maintenance Mode
* Hub: It is an automatic system (It means that it detects the available hubs)
* Media Commands: Youtube, Media, Partner, Famous
* BungeeCommand: to reload config.yml 
* Other commands: server, find
* System kick: Kicking any mode will send the user to the first hub it finds and thus avoid being completely kicked from the server.
